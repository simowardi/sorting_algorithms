C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
This is an algorithm-based project in C Programming Language, by Ayomide Suara and Mohamed Ibrahima Traore during the Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. Several sorting algorithms are implemented, as well as their corresponding Big O notations.

Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
0. Bubble sort

0-bubble_sort.c: C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Prints the array after each swap.
0-O: Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Bubble Sort algorithm, one per line.
1. Insertion sort

1-insertion_sort_list.c: C function that sorts a listint_t doubly-linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
Prints the list after each swap.
1-O: Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Insertion Sort algorithm, one per line.
2. Selection sort

2-selection_sort.c: C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.
Prints the array after each swap.
2-O: Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Selection Sort algorithm, one per line.
3. Quick sort

3-quick_sort.c: C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick Sort algorithm.
Implements the Lomuto partition scheme.
Always uses the last element of the partition being sorted as the pivot.
Prints the array after each swap.
3-O: Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Quick Sort Lomuto Partition scheme algorithm, one per line.
